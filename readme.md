# CSS Box Model Practice

Your goal is to recreate the CSS for the website to make it match the mockup image.

- Add appropriate margin, border, and padding to the text div.   
- Add appropriate border to the image.
- Create a div for all of the page content and center that in the middle of the page.
- Add appropriate border and padding to that div.

Hints: 

- Look up border-style, there should be a border style on the image and text. 
- This weeks reading talks about centering a div, read “centering with auto-margins”
